# My Personal Project - Meme Stock Portfolio

## :rainbow: :bear:

My application will allow users to create a portfolio consisting of meme stocks, in the style of Reddit's 
*r/wallstreetbets* community. Users will be able to pick stocks from a pre-defined list, or add their own stonks to YOLO.

Users will be able to run a simulation of how their stocks perform 
over time. Will their :gem: :raised_hands: diamond hands :raised_hands: :gem: pay off as their stock goes :rocket: 
:rocket: to the moon :first_quarter_moon_with_face: :full_moon_with_face:, or will they lose it all and prove the 
:rainbow: :bear: bears right??

Users will be people interested in everything *r/wallstreetbets*. Alternatively, :triumph: **activists** :triumph: who are interested in 
sticking it to Wall Street, on behalf of Main Street, are also welcome to use the application. 

NB: if you are an experienced investor looking for an intelligent way to understand your portfolio and risk profile, 
please head elsewhere. Only degenerate "investors" welcome.
